"""Video push for third-party (ONVIF) cameras assigned to the AI Port.

When an ONVIF camera is assigned, Protect stops ingesting it itself and hands
the job to the AI Port: OnvifStreamControl carries the camera's RTSP URL, and
ChangeVideoSettings asks for each channel (video1/2/3) as an "extendedFlv"
stream pushed to tcp://<console>:7550 under a given streamName. Without that
push the camera shows no video and records nothing.

OnvifStreamControl names only the camera's main profile. video2 and video3, the
medium (720p) and low channels on a UniFi camera, get the camera's substream
instead when its ONVIF Media service lists a smaller H.264 profile
(onvif_media.py); video1 stays on the main one. Both share one pull, so the
camera sees no extra RTSP session.

Each push is `ffmpeg -c:v copy -f flv -` (no re-encode) piped through
rewrite_flv() into a TCP socket. The rewrite mirrors unifi-cam-proxy's
clock_sync.py (MIT, keshavdv/unifi-cam-proxy): header flags byte 7, a 16-byte
timing trailer after every tag, and onClockSync/onMpma script tags every 5s.
One deliberate difference: the trailer's elapsed time is written in the
timescale the trailer itself declares (90 kHz video, 11025 otherwise).
clock_sync.py writes 10-microsecond units for both, which Protect 7.x reads as
video running 11% and audio 9x too fast; its media server then drops the frames
as "from the future" and the web player never starts.

# An ONVIF camera's video runs one of three ways, set by AIPORT_ONVIF_MODE: a default, then any
# per-camera exceptions, as `isolated,AABBCCDDEEFF=copy`, so cameras can move one at a time.
#   copy (the default)  below's "copy"; pushes run in avclient. Works anywhere.
#   transcode           below's "option C"; pushes run in avclient.
#   isolated            option C, with pushes in a process per camera (onvif_restream.py).
#
# copy: ffmpeg pulls the camera's main stream and substream and copies them.
#
# Option C: what the AI Port itself does with an ONVIF camera. Its ubnt_av_aiport
# (v5.1.12, Ghidra) pulls the main stream once with rtspsrc protocols=tcp latency=500
# tcp-timeout=5000000, decodes it once (v4l2dec) and re-encodes one stream per channel (S0
# with a 1 s GOP, S1 GOP 24 at 2 Mbps, S2 at 300 kbps), so every channel Protect plays was
# made by its own encoder at a steady rate. Here one gst-launch does the same with
# VideoToolbox (vtdec, one vtenc_h264 per channel), each channel on its own pipe: one RTSP
# session per camera instead of main + substream. video2 is encoded at the substream's size
# and video3 at TRANSCODE_VIDEO3_HEIGHT, as Protect is told (ChangeVideoSettings). macOS
# only; needs `brew install gstreamer` (1.28.8 tested). Live 2026-11-03/04 on Driveway: the
# user found it more stable than ffmpeg or a copied GStreamer pull, with a better picture,
# and it held 20 fps for 10 h 48 min.
#
# It also sends clock syncs as yi-protect's FlvPush does, "matching a real G3": onMpma +
# onClockSync at connection start (after onMetaData, before the codec configs), then
# onClockSync + onMpma before every key frame, 10 s fallback. Live 02:22 on Driveway
# (2026-11-03): Protect plays this camera through an fMP4 player with useWallClock=1
# (unifi-cam-proxy's Driveway gets a UBNT one), and with a sync every 5 s a cold start played
# ~1 s then paused ~5 s, as if waiting for the next sync to place frames on the wall clock.
# A sync every 1 s was worse; G3 sync was "very stable".
